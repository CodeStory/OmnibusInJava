# Omnibus Java Implementation

This is a really simple java implementation of the Omnibus "algorithm" for the contest of the 3rd season of [CodeStory](code-story.net).

# Building
This code is meant to be more read than run, so we suggest you fire you favorite java IDE and import the project.
We have only one dependency which is [Spark](http://www.sparkjava.com/).

# Running

From within you IDE you'll find the `Server` class. This class has a main method you can call from within your IDE to start a server.

If you can also issue a `mvn exec:java` from the source root and start a the server right away.
